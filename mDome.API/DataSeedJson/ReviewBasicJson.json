    "reviewText": "Exploding Head, in my opinion, is better than their self-titled debut. It's dark industrial sounding noise rock at it's best. It sorta has a new wave feel to it throughout the whole album. All In All, A Place To Bury Strangers has crafted a pretty strange, psychedelic mix of noise in Exploding Head.",
